# About Interview Questions and Test itself

    There would be no algorithms on this interview.

a) Verbal questions - You will be asked simple frontend developer questions - Example: What is Footer ?

Importance filtering out the middleman and people that don't know how to code

b) Coding Interview and Search Engine Usage

There will be 4 tasks ahead of you. Don't worry this is not 'leetcode' or 'adventcode'. So please relax. There are no algorithms on this interview.

    TASK_1 is very simple
    TASK_2 is simple
    TASK_3 is standard and you need to use libraries that are in the repository
    TASK_4 is a bit more complex and you need to use extral library that will be presented to you and make it work

    You can use external resources for TAKS 3 and TAKS 4 (Google âœ…, StackOverflow âœ…, Search Engine âœ… of your choice)

    ðŸ›‘ Chat-GPT-3 IS NOT ALLOWED !! Github Copilot is not allowed! ðŸ›‘
